# Simple Football Game

## Description

A full-stack prototype of a simple football game.  The main purpose was to challenge myself to get a working three-tier architecture with at least one technology in each tier that I had never used before.

At the moment the game itself is a very basic prototype that will have many features added later.  The full stack from client to server to database should all be working together correctly.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node.js required to run

### Technologies Used

- Front End
    - Reactjs
    - axios
- Server/API
    - node.js with express and mongoose
- Database
    - mongodb

### Executing Program

On command line or terminal run:

1. `npm -i`
2. `npm start` from the directory containing football-react/src/index.js to start react app
3. `nodemon testAPI.js` from directory football-express2 to start server
